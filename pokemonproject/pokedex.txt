Search for a pokemon by number or name, including partial match and display all information about it in a human readable form
Construct a team of 6 pokemon, each of which has 4 active moves, out of the ones available. After the team has been chosen, it will be output into a similarly formatted JSON file,
 with only the active moves included
Filter the JSON by any combination of: type, speed range, height range, weight range, HP range and output the result into a JSON file

height_range = []
threshold = input
for user in users_data:
    if user["plan_type"] == "basic" and user["data_usage"] > threshold:
        basic_high_usage.append(user)
print(basic_high_usage)
